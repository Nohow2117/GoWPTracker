# GoWPTracker

**GoWPTracker** is a WordPress plugin that tracks outbound clicks from pre-landing pages (PLPs) to an external e-commerce site.  
It uses a server-side redirect (`/go`) to log essential data (PLP, UTM parameters, referrer, user agent, timestamp) before sending the user to the destination.

---

## ðŸš€ Purpose
When running ads (e.g., Facebook Ads) you may split traffic across multiple pre-landing pages before sending users to your shop.  
Without tracking, you cannot know which PLP generates the most clicks to your store.  

**GoWPTracker solves this** by logging every click server-side, giving you a clear report of which PLPs drive the most traffic and which campaigns perform best.
